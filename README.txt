 SpeedHack Rules
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This years speedhack required the following:
The game had to have some element of instanity
The game had to contain some reference to bananas
The game had to have an element of time
The game had to have multiple players
The game must show no humans
And, as a bonus rule, the game could use recursion in some way.

Sadly, I didn't do a very good job at fulfuling these rules (because
of time issues). There isn't much instanity in my game... the closest
thing that got to insane is the ending boss (he laughes). I fit banana
reference in at the end (something that I had planned from the beggining,
but because of time issues I wasn't able to do it with as much style as
I had hoped). However, there are no humanoids at all in my game, and it
_is_ multiplayer. For my time element, I have a gauge of some type
continuously going down, and the player is required to collect items
to replenish it.


 About the Game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Your character is a squid. It's kind of like a space shooter game 
except it's not in space (I was thinking of Gradius when I made it). It's
pretty long and it has a steep learning curve. I believe it's going to 
be very hard for most people. (It was almost impossible before I added
checkpoints). As I have stated before, because of time issues I was not
able to fit everything in that I had origonally planned. There are no
sound effects, there's no music, and no menus. However, there is one
very large level, and some cool looking effects and graphics. At the end
(if anyone gets that far), there's even a boss. 



 How to Play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Player One Controls:
Up: W
Down: S
Left: A
Right: D
Fire: Space

Up: Numpad 8
Down: Numpad 5

Throughought the entire game the camera is moving up the screen. Your job 
is to avoid touching enemies and obstacles by using your water blast gun thing, 
basic movement, and dashing. To dash, press the dash button while holding a 
directional key. 

Your squid is surrounded by a bubble of water. Every second your bubble looses a
bit of water. If it runs too low, you will die. Collect water puddles to replenish
you bubble. Also, every time you dash or shoot, you will lose a small amount of water.

To make the game a little easier, a number of checkpoints have been scattered 
throughout the map. You cannot see them, but if you happen to die, you will
start back at the last checkpoint you passed. 

To quit the game, simply press escape. To open the map editor, press M. To return 
to your game (at your last checkpoint) press N.

Good luck!
